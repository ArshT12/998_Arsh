# Enhanced Dataset Selection and Justification Report for Deepfake Voice Detection

## 1. Executive Summary
To develop a robust and generalizable audio deepfake detection system, we have meticulously curated a multi-source, balanced, and rationale-driven dataset. Our comprehensive approach addresses the challenges of modern voice synthesis technology by incorporating diverse audio sources that span multiple dimensions of variation. The final dataset comprises:

- **MLAAD (Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset)**: A comprehensive multilingual anti-spoofing benchmark containing diverse text-to-speech (TTS) artifacts and synthesis methodologies.
- **FakeAVCeleb (Audio variant)**: Fine-grained multimodal deepfake audio extracted from video deepfakes, providing cross-modal context.
- **YouTube Real Speech**: Long-form genuine audio from speeches, interviews, and podcasts, capturing natural human vocal patterns and environmental acoustics.
- **YouTube Gaming Fake Commentary**: Synthetic gaming commentary containing background noise and expressive artifacts, representing real-world application scenarios.

Each source was strategically selected to cover complementary axes of variation—language, TTS technology, recording conditions, and modality—and then carefully chunked and balanced to arrive at 31,403 real and 19,596 fake samples. This document provides an in-depth examination of the justification, composition, preprocessing methodology, and future extensibility of our final dataset.

## 2. Selection Criteria and Justification
We established rigorous criteria before data acquisition to ensure both real-world relevance and technical rigor in our dataset construction:

| Criterion | Explanation | Reason for Inclusion | Implementation Details |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Linguistic Diversity | Coverage of multiple languages to avoid English-centric bias | Real-world deepfakes occur in any language; models must generalize across linguistic boundaries | Included 35+ languages from MLAAD; supplemented with multilingual snippets from YouTube sources |
| TTS Coverage | Incorporation of multiple synthesis engines and architectural approaches | Enable detection of artifacts across various voice cloning methods, from traditional concatenative to modern neural approaches | Selected 59-91 distinct TTS systems from MLAAD spanning commercial, open-source, and research implementations |
| Recording Conditions | Mixture of studio-quality and noisy/reverberant recordings | Ensure robustness against variable background noise, microphone quality, and acoustic environments | Combined clean studio recordings with "in-the-wild" audio featuring ambient noise, reverberation, and variable recording equipment |
| Modal Context | Inclusion of both audio-only and audio extracted from audiovisual fakes | Train specialized detection strategies that account for cross-modal optimization artifacts | Extracted audio from FakeAVCeleb to capture lip-sync optimized speech generation patterns |
| Data Volume & Balance | Sufficient sample counts per class with uniform chunking methodology | Prevent overfitting and skewed learning in model training | Implemented strategic sampling to balance representation while maintaining sufficient volume |
| Temporal Diversity | Variable-length samples that capture both short-term spectral and long-term prosodic features | Ensure models can detect artifacts at multiple temporal scales | Chunked source material into 5-10 second segments to balance context and computational efficiency |
| Feature Compatibility | Consideration of downstream feature extraction requirements | Facilitate extraction of standard acoustic features proven in speech processing | Maintained uniform sampling rate (22.05 kHz) and bit depth (16-bit PCM) across sources |

By systematically mapping each data source against these criteria, we developed a multi-faceted dataset that maximizes coverage across critical dimensions of variation in both real and synthetic speech.
