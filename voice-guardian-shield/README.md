# Voice Guardian Shield

> A real-time voice authentication system that detects deepfake audio during phone calls using AI-powered analysis.

## Overview

Voice Guardian Shield is a mobile application that monitors phone calls in real-time to detect potential deepfake or AI-generated voices. The app runs in the background during calls and uses advanced machine learning models to analyze voice patterns and alert users to potential voice spoofing attempts.

### Option 2: iOS Testing (Full Functionality)
**Prerequisites:** macOS with Xcode installed

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/ArshT12/voice-guardian-shield.git
cd voice-guardian-shield

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build the application
npm run build

# 4. Sync to iOS
npx cap sync ios

# 5. Open in Xcode
npx cap open ios
```
- In Xcode: Select a simulator or connected device
- Click the "Play" button to build and run
- **Note:** Real call monitoring requires a physical iOS device

### Testing the Core Features
1. **Interface Navigation**: Test all screens and user interactions
2. **Settings Configuration**: Access app settings and permissions
3. **Call Monitoring**: 
   - Web version: Interface demonstration only
   - iOS device: Actual call monitoring functionality
4. **Background Service**: Verify the app can run in background (iOS device only)

## Development Setup (For Full Development)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArshT12/voice-guardian-shield.git
   cd voice-guardian-shield
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the web application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Setup iOS development environment**
   ```bash
   # Sync web code to iOS
   npx cap sync ios
   
   # Open in Xcode
   npx cap open ios
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   - For web development: `npm run dev`
   - For iOS: Build and run through Xcode
   - For Android: Build and run through Android Studio

##  Development Workflow

### Web Development

**Start development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`

**Build for production:**
```bash
npm run build
```

### Mobile Development

After making changes to the web code:

1. **Build the web app**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Sync changes to native projects**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync              # All platforms
   npx cap sync ios          # iOS only
   npx cap sync android      # Android only
   ```

3. **Open native IDEs**
   ```bash
   npx cap open ios          # Open Xcode
   npx cap open android      # Open Android Studio
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### iOS Build Issues

**Signing Issues:**
1. In Xcode, select the App project
2. Navigate to Signing & Capabilities
3. Check "Automatically manage signing"
4. Select your personal team

**Dependency Version Conflicts:**
- Ensure all Capacitor packages have compatible versions
- iOS platform requires Capacitor 7.0.0+ for background-runner plugin

**Pod Installation Failures:**
```bash
# Update CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods

# Clean cache
pod cache clean --all

# Reset pods (if needed)
cd ios/App
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install
```

**Permission Issues:**
- Ensure proper microphone permissions in `Info.plist`
